To calculate the Moment of Inertia (MoI) of a robot with the given parameters, we can assume a simplified model where the robot is treated as a **rectangular plate with uniform mass distribution**. The formula for the MoI of a rectangular plate rotating about its center is:

$$
I = \frac{1}{12} m (a^2 + b^2)
$$

Where:
- $$m$$ is the mass of the object,
- $$a$$ and $$b$$ are the length and width of the rectangle.

### Given Parameters:
- Mass ($$m$$) = 68 kg,
- Length ($$a$$) = 14.5 in ($$0.3683$$ m),
- Width ($$b$$) = 14.5 in ($$0.3683$$ m).

### Calculation:
Converting all measurements to SI units:
- $$a = b = 0.3683 \, \text{m}$$.

Substitute into the formula:
$$
I = \frac{1}{12} \times 68 \times (0.3683^2 + 0.3683^2)
$$

First, calculate $$a^2 + b^2$$:
$$
a^2 + b^2 = 0.3683^2 + 0.3683^2 = 0.1356 + 0.1356 = 0.2712
$$

Now calculate $$I$$:
$$
I = \frac{1}{12} \times 68 \times 0.2712
$$
$$
I = \frac{1}{12} \times 18.4416 = 1.5368 \, \text{kg·m}^2
$$

### Final Result:
The estimated Moment of Inertia (MoI) of the robot is approximately **1.54 kg·m²** assuming a uniform mass distribution.
